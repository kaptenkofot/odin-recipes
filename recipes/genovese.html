        wine red as blood and
        eaten without regard for future health issues.</p>
    <p>Preparing a Genovese is not as easy as it may first seem, using only ten ingredients all of them need to be of
        the best quality and in excatly the right proportions.</p>

        <li>1 garlic clove </li>
        <li>1 tbsp of pine nuts</li>
        <li>40g of basil</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp of Parmesan, finely grated (plus extra to serve)</li>
        <li>3 tbsp of pecorino, finely grated (plus extra to serve)</li>

    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by making the pesto. Using either a pestle and mortar or blender, grind the garlic, pine nuts and salt
            to a fine paste. Add the basil and oil then transfer to a bowl and stir in the grated Parmesan and Pecorino.
            If not using immediately, cover the pesto with extra oil to prevent it discolouring (due to oxidation)

        <li>Peel and cut the potato into 2cm cubes. Cook until tender in salted boiling water</li>
        <li>4 minutes before the pasta is ready, add the green beans to the pan
        </li>
        <li>Drain and stir through the pesto and the potatoes. Serve immediately with a drizzle of extra virgin oil and
            finely grated Parmesan or Pecorino (or both!)</li>
