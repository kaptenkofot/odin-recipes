    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>When the flying pasta monster feels ambitious it is time to cook a Bolognese. Best served with a wine red as
        blood and
        eaten without regard for future health issues.</p>
    <p>Preparing a Bolognese is not very complicated, but using fine ingredients one must not make mistakes.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>300g of beef mince, 15% fat
        </li>
        <li>150g of pork mince
        </li>
        <li>50g of unsalted butter
        </li>
        <li>50g of onion, finely chopped
        </li>
        <li>50g of carrots, finely chopped
        </li>
        <li>50g of celery, finely chopped
        </li>
        <li>125ml of red wine
        </li>
        <li>30g of tomato paste, triple concentrated
        </li>
        <li>salt & black pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a large thick-bottomed saucepan over a medium heat. Add the minced pork belly to the pot and cook
            until all the liquid from the meat has evaporated, then add the minced beef and cook until golden, stirring
            frequently. Transfer the meat to a bowl and set aside
        </li>
        <li>Add the butter to the saucepan and place over a medium heat. Add the onion, carrot and celery and cook until
            the onions are very soft and translucent. Finally, add the tomato paste and sauté for 5 minutes more,
            stirring occasionally</li>
        <li>Cook the pancetta in a large frying pan until crispy. Once cooked, reserve the pancetta and the fat that has
            been released during cooking separately</li>
        <li>Return the meat to the saucepan, turn up the heat and pour in the red wine. Cook over a high heat for 2
            minutes, then cover the pan and turn the heat down to low</li>
        <li>Leave the ragù alla Bolognese to simmer very gently for at least 3 hours. The meat must not be excessively
            dry. Pour in the whole milk and cook for a further 40 minutes just before serving</li>
        <li>Ragù alla Bolognese is very tasty when just cooked, but is even better the next day. Reheat the sauce over a
            very low heat with a little bit of milk and use it to season pasta or simply eat it with slices of toasted
            bread</li>

    </ol>
